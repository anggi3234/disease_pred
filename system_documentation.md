# Disease Risk Prediction System Documentation

## System Overview

The disease risk prediction system is a comprehensive health assessment tool that combines various lifestyle, environmental, and health factors to generate personalized risk scores and recommendations. The system follows a modular approach with distinct components for data collection, processing, risk calculation, and recommendation generation.

## Data Collection and Processing

### 1. Feature Engineering

The system processes raw questionnaire data into numerical features through several specialized functions:

#### 1.1 Demographic Features
```python
features['age'] = data['personal']['age']
features['bmi'] = data['personal']['weight'] / ((data['personal']['height']/100) ** 2)
features['gender_male'] = 1 if data['personal']['sex'] == 'Male' else 0
```

BMI calculation follows WHO standards:
- Underweight: < 18.5
- Normal: 18.5 - 24.9
- Overweight: 25 - 29.9
- Obese: â‰¥ 30

### 2. Risk Score Calculations

#### 2.1 Diet Quality Score
```python
def calculate_diet_quality(diet_data):
    score = 0
    max_score = 8
    
    # Healthy food contributions
    score += min(convert_portion(diet_data['fruits']) / 3, 1)
    score += min(convert_portion(diet_data['vegetables']) / 3, 1)
    score += min(convert_portion(diet_data['whole_grains']) / 3, 1)
    score += min(convert_portion(diet_data['fish']) / 2, 1)
    score += min(convert_portion(diet_data['legumes']) / 2, 1)
```

Based on:
- Mediterranean Diet Score components
- Harvard Healthy Eating Plate guidelines
- WHO dietary recommendations

#### 2.2 Physical Activity Score (MET Hours)
```python
def calculate_met_hours(activity_data):
    intensity_to_met = {
        'Light': 2.5,
        'Moderate': 4.5,
        'Vigorous': 7.0,
        'Very vigorous': 10.0
    }
```

MET values based on:
- Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al., 2011)
- WHO Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health

#### 2.3 Sleep Score
```python
def calculate_sleep_score(lifestyle_data):
    sleep_hours_map = {
        '<5': 0.2,
        '5-6': 0.4,
        '6-7': 0.6,
        '7-8': 1.0,
        '8-9': 0.8,
        '9+': 0.6
    }
```

Based on:
- National Sleep Foundation guidelines
- Sleep duration recommendations by age group

### 3. Risk Score Components

#### 3.1 Metabolic Health Risk
```python
metabolic_risk = (
    0.25 * (features['bmi'] - 18.5) / (30 - 18.5) +  # BMI contribution
    0.2 * (1 - features['diet_quality']) +           # Diet contribution
    0.15 * (1 - min(features['met_hours'] / 40, 1)) + # Activity contribution
    0.15 * features['eating_behavior_score'] +       # Eating behavior
    0.15 * features['stress_score'] +                # Stress contribution
    0.1 * features['smoking_risk']                   # Smoking contribution
)
```

Weightings based on:
- WHO risk factor studies
- Meta-analyses of lifestyle factors in metabolic health
- Clinical guidelines for metabolic syndrome

#### 3.2 Cardiovascular Risk
```python
cv_risk = (
    0.2 * (features['age'] - 20) / (80 - 20) +      # Age contribution
    0.2 * (1 - features['diet_quality']) +          # Diet contribution
    0.15 * (1 - min(features['met_hours'] / 40, 1)) + # Activity contribution
    0.15 * features['stress_score'] +               # Stress contribution
    0.15 * features['smoking_risk'] +               # Smoking contribution
    0.15 * features['health_condition_score']       # Existing conditions
)
```

Based on:
- Framingham Risk Score components
- ACC/AHA Cardiovascular Risk Calculator
- European SCORE risk estimation

#### 3.3 Environmental Health Risk
```python
env_risk = (
    0.4 * features['environmental_risk'] +          # Environmental exposures
    0.3 * (1 - features['sun_exposure_score']) +    # Sun exposure
    0.3 * features['symptom_severity']              # Symptoms contribution
)
```

Factors considered from:
- WHO Environmental Health Risk Assessment Guidelines
- EPA Environmental Risk Assessment frameworks

### 4. Implementation Details

#### 4.1 Data Normalization
All risk scores are normalized to a 0-1 scale where:
- 0 represents minimal risk
- 1 represents maximum risk

#### 4.2 Score Thresholds
```python
if risk_scores['metabolic_health'] > 0.6:  # High risk threshold
    recommendations.append({
        'category': 'Metabolic Health',
        'recommendations': [...]
    })
```

Threshold values based on:
- Clinical risk assessment guidelines
- Population health statistics
- Expert consensus on risk stratification

#### 4.3 Recommendation Generation
Recommendations are generated using a rule-based system that considers:
- Individual risk scores
- Specific contributing factors
- Current health conditions
- Lifestyle patterns

### 5. Validation and Limitations

The current system has several limitations:
1. Simplified risk calculations compared to full clinical models
2. Self-reported data limitations
3. No longitudinal tracking
4. Limited genetic data integration

Future improvements could include:
1. Machine learning model integration
2. Real-time biometric data
3. Integration with electronic health records
4. Expanded genetic risk factors

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented using:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit for UI
- Pandas for data processing
- NumPy for numerical computations

Key files:
- `app.py`: Main application file
- `system_documentation.md`: This documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

The application follows a modular design pattern with separate functions for:
1. Data collection (questionnaire sections)
2. Data processing (feature engineering)
3. Risk calculation (score computation)
4. Recommendation generation
5. Results display

This modular approach allows for:
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Independent testing of components
- Future expansion of functionality
- Integration with other systems
